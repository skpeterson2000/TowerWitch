## Installation

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install system dependencies
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip gpsd gpsd-clients

# Install Python dependencies
pip3 install PyQt5 requests utm maidenhead mgrs
```

### Quick Start
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TowerWitch.git
cd TowerWitch

# Use automated launcher (recommended)
chmod +x towerwitch.sh
./towerwitch.sh

# OR configure manually:
# Copy configuration template (optional - works without API)
cp towerwitch_config.ini.example towerwitch_config.ini
# Edit towerwitch_config.ini with your Radio Reference API credentials (optional)

# Run TowerWitch directly
python3 TowerWitch-P.py
```

**Note:** TowerWitch works immediately with built-in CSV databases - no API setup required!

## Configuration

### Radio Reference API Setup (Recommended)
1. Sign up at [Radio Reference](https://www.radioreference.com/)
2. Get your API credentials from account settings
3. Edit `towerwitch_config.ini`:
```ini
[API]
radio_reference_username = your_username
radio_reference_password = your_password
```

### Alternative: CSV Data Sources (No API Required)
**Don't have a Radio Reference premium account?** TowerWitch includes comprehensive CSV databases:

- **`trs_sites_3508.csv`** - Complete ARMER (Minnesota P25) site database
- **`AmateurSimplex.csv`** - Amateur radio simplex frequencies by band
- **Built-in Static Data** - Extensive repeater databases for emergency fallback

TowerWitch automatically uses these CSV sources when:
- No API credentials are configured
- API is temporarily unavailable
- Working in offline environments
- Limited API calls remaining

**Benefits of CSV mode:**
- ✅ **No subscription required** - Works immediately out of the box
- ✅ **Offline capability** - Perfect for remote field operations  
- ✅ **Fast performance** - No network delays
- ✅ **Emergency backup** - Always available as fallback

### GPS Configuration
TowerWitch uses `gpsd` for GPS data:
```bash
# Start GPS daemon
sudo systemctl enable gpsd
sudo systemctl start gpsd

# Test GPS connection
cgps -s
```

### UDP Broadcasting Configuration
TowerWitch can broadcast nearest tower data via UDP for integration with external systems:

```ini
[UDP]
enabled = true
port = 12345
broadcast_ip = 255.255.255.255
send_interval = 25
```

**Broadcasting Features:**
- **Real-time Data** - GPS location and closest ARMER towers
- **JSON Format** - Structured data for easy parsing
- **Configurable** - Port, IP, interval, and tower count
- **Smart Timing** - Automatic rate limiting to prevent spam

**Test UDP Reception:**
```bash
# Use included test listener
python3 test_udp_listener.py

# Or with netcat
nc -ul 12345
```

**Broadcast Data Format:**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-11-07T12:34:56",
  "source": "TowerWitch",
  "gps_lat": 44.9778,
  "gps_lon": -93.2650,
  "speed_mps": 15.5,
  "is_vehicle_speed": true,
  "closest_armer_towers": [
    {
      "site_name": "Tower Name",
      "distance": "2.3 mi",
      "bearing": "045°",
      "nac": "NAC123",
      "control_channels": "851.0125, 852.5125"
    }
  ]
}
```

- **Emergency Coordination** - Share tower data with command centers
- **Mobile Applications** - Receive data from TowerWitch on other devices

**Setup:**
1. Enable UDP in configuration file or leave default (enabled)
2. Configure firewall if needed: `sudo ufw allow 12345/udp`
3. Test reception: `python3 test_udp_listener.py`
4. Integrate JSON data into your applications

**Data Updates:**
- Broadcasts every 25 seconds (configurable)
- Includes 2 closest ARMER towers (configurable)
- Automatic rate limiting to prevent network spam
- Only sends when tower data is available

## Serving repeaters to ELMER

Two Pis in one vehicle: only one has TowerWitch and the RadioReference
credentials. `repeater_service.py` lets the other one ask over the network
instead of copying a CSV by hand at a campsite.

```bash
python3 repeater_service.py          # serves on 0.0.0.0:8137
```

```
GET /api/repeaters?lat=46.59836&lon=-94.31539&radius_km=100

{"data": [
  {"call": "W0UJ", "output": 146.955, "input": 146.355, "offset": -0.6,
   "tone": "141.3", "location": "Nisswa", "lat": 46.5216, "lon": -94.2883}
]}
```

That is the shape TowerWitch already writes into `radio_cache`, so ELMER's
existing parser reads it unchanged. On the other machine:

```bash
./elmer.py --towerwitch-url http://192.168.1.5:8137/api/repeaters
```

It looks nothing up. It serves the cached lookups and RepeaterBook exports
TowerWitch has already found - the subscription is TowerWitch's to hold, not
this endpoint's to spend on behalf of whoever asks. Parsed rows are cached
against file mtime, so a lookup done while parked is picked up on the next
request without a restart.

To run it at boot, `systemd/towerwitch-repeaters.service` is a template:

```bash
sed -e "s|__USER__|$USER|g" -e "s|__DIR__|$PWD|g" \
    systemd/towerwitch-repeaters.service \
  | sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/towerwitch-repeaters.service >/dev/null
sudo systemctl enable --now towerwitch-repeaters
```
